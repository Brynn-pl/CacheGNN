## About
- This is our implementation for the paper:  
[Attention Matters: Session-based Recommendation withMulti-Prior Attention Mixture Network]

## Table of Contents  
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Dataset](#dataset)
- [Model Training and Testing](#model-training-and-testing)
- [Atten-Mixer Enhancement Study](#atten-mixer-enhancement-study)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7.9
- Other common packages listed in `environment.yaml`  
- Install required environment: `conda env create -f environment.yaml`  

## Dataset
Three widely used dataset are adopted:  

- [DIGINETICA](http://cikm2016.cs.iupui.edu/cikm-cup): It is a transaction dataset that is obtained from CIKM Cup 2016 Challange.  
- [GOWALLA](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html): It is a dataset that contains usersâ€™ check-in infor- mation for point-of-interest recommendation.
- [Last.fm](http://ocelma.net/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-1K.html): It is a music-artist dataset that is used for music interest recommendation.

We have provided the preprocessed version in the folder `datasets/`.

## Model Training and Testing
- To train our model on DIGINETICA, after changing the dataset path in `src/dataset.py`, run from the root of the project:
```
cd src

python main_area_semantic.py --dataset diginetica
```
- To train our model on GOWALLA, after changing the dataset path in `src/dataset.py`, run from the root of the project:
```
cd src

python main_area_semantic.py --dataset gowalla
```
- To train our model on Last.fm, after changing the dataset path in `src/dataset.py`, run from the root of the project:
```
cd src

python main_area_semantic.py --dataset lastfm
```
To test our model on each dataset, we add following parameters after the above corresponding commands:
```
--tran_flag False --PATH ../checkpoint/saved_model_name
```
For example, to test our model on DIGINETICA:
```
cd src

python main_area_semantic.py --dataset diginetica --tran_flag False --PATH ../checkpoint/model.pt
```


## Atten-Mixer Enhancement Study 
- We provide our implemented two Atten-Mixer enhanced model: GNN with Atten-Mixer (GNN-AM) and SGNN-HN with Atten-Mixer (SGNN-HN-AM) for users to run and test:
    - [GNN-AM/model.py]
        - Example usuage of how to plug in our idea into SR-GNN
        -  [Line 15-61] 

    - [SGNN-HN-AM/model_star.py]
        - Example usuage of how to plug in our idea into SGNN-HN
        -  [Line 88-130] 
- **Notes:** 
To run the above models on each dataset: 
    - To train our model on DIGINETICA, after changing the dataset path in `main.py`, run from the root of the project:
```
cd GNN-AM/SGNN-HN-AM

python main.py --dataset diginetica
```
- To train our model on GOWALLA, after changing the dataset path in `main.py`, run from the root of the project:
```
cd GNN-AM/SGNN-HN-AM

python main.py --dataset gowalla
```
- To train our model on Last.fm, after changing the dataset path in `main.py`, run from the root of the project:
```
cd GNN-AM/SGNN-HN-AM

python main.py --dataset lastfm
```
The test command is also adding the following parameters after the above corresponding commands:
```
--tran_flag False --PATH ../checkpoint/saved_model_name
```
For example, to test our model on DIGINETICA:
```
cd GNN-AM/SGNN-HN-AM

python main.py --dataset diginetica --tran_flag False --PATH ../checkpoint/model.pt
```
